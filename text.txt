I Want to be a Programmer

I want to become a computer programmer. I am interested in computers. It is a whole new world.

Many people continue careers of their parents or grand parents but it is not the case with me. My mother is a teacher and my father is a doctor. But I don't want to be neither a teacher nor a doctor.

My favourite subjects in school are mathematics, physics, and, of course, computer science. I am not interested in such subjects as geography, biology or chemistry. My hobby is computer games and computer programming.

I have a computer at home and can spend hours working at it. It is much easier to do things on computer, for example to write a composition. You can change the text as many times as you want and you don't need to rewrite everything if you changed something.

I think that the profession of programmer can give many opportunities. Computers are the most rapidly changing sphere of modern technology. We are living in the age of information. And I think that the future is just filled with computers.

Bye bye bye!
